Help convert Guarda wallet keys to other formats

I wanted to export my Guarda Cosmos wallet and import it in the Keplr wallet extension. However, the formats did not match.
I created this repository to help me and others convert their exported Guarda wallet to Keplr extension private key. 

How to use:
1. Install NodeJS
2. Put your exported key from Guarda in the CosmosForKeplr.js.
3. Run the program. The actual private key is printed then.

If you have any questions and it is not obvious, ask me.
